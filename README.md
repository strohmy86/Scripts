# Scripts

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/strohmy86/Scripts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/strohmy86/Scripts)

Simple scripts to make my job easier.

Most of these scripts are written specifically to my work environment, but you can edit them to suit your needs. 

All I ask is that if you fork this repo, please give me credit for the code that you use in your own project.
